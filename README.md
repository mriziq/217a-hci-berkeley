# AI Dashboard Design Shapes Trust and Transparency

This project is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application designed to emulate ChatGPT with an integrated transparency dashboard. It features an experimental dashboard that reveals ChatGPT's assumptions, leveraging a "Wizard of Oz" prototype to explore AI transparency.

## Features
- Assumption Display: Shows the AIâ€™s real-time assumptions about the user (the "user model").
- Wizard of Oz Prototype: Predefined assumptions simulate AI's user model.
- "Check Engine" Reliability Avatar: Dashboard is accessible via a clickable avatar. Change in color signals to users when to check dashboard.
